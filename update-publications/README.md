# Update Publications
To use update-publications:  
  1. Edit TERM in pubmed_to_csv to match Author you're looking for, along with any additional parameters that might clean up the search.
  2. Run pubmed_to_csv, which will output a csv file.
  3. Remove extraneous papers from the csv file.
  4. Run csv_to_txt to output text file with publication citations.
  5. Clean up issue portion of citations (last section). Pubmed_to_csv does not currently clean them up properly.
  6. Copy the text to your website/CV/whatever!
